# Exercise 1

This exercise will let you explore and execute a simple Bazel build. You are not expected to understand all concepts and mechanics, rather you just want to get a first taste of Bazel, the build tool.

1. Inspect the three files in the directory named `start`: `WORKSPACE`, `BUILD`, and `rule.bzl`.
2. Open a shell, navigate to this directory, and run the command `bazel build //:hello_world`. Have a look at the console output and try to find the build logic that renders the `DEBUG` statement. Do you expect any artifacts that should be generated by the build?
3. Change the parameter value used by the rule that renders the message to the console. Run the build again to verify that the message has changed.
4. Change the name of the target in the `BUILD` file. Execute the build with the new target name.
