# Exercise 3

In this exercise, you will install an IDE plugin/extension for Bazel and use it on a build.

1. If you are an IntelliJ user, install the [Bazel IDE plugin](https://ij.bazel.build/). If you are a VSCode user, install the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/bazelbuild/vscode-bazel).
2. Open the solution of the previous exercise in the IDE.
3. Execute the Bazel `build` command from the IDE.
4. Explore the auto-completion feature for a `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD` file in the IDE.
