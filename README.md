# Bazel-learning-paths
This repo has materials for learning Bazel: codelabs, presentations, examples.
We are open sourcing the content for training engineers in using Bazel and becoming contributors, so that we can growth this community.

The program includes a diverse delivery methods such as docs, instruction and codelabs, and focuses on the following user personas as learning paths: 
- Engineer- quick start with Bazel (beginner)
- Bazel platform engineer & operator (advanced)
- Bazel contributor (expert)

This effort is an initial collaboration between:
- Automated Ascent https://automatedascent.com/ created by Benjamin Muschko, author of "Getting Started with Bazel" book
- EngFlow https://www.engflow.com, a Bazel tools company created by Ulf Adams, who led the development and open-sourcing of Bazel, and Helen Altshuler who led the Bazel developer adoption
We'd love the community feedback and participation!

This project is currently under development, so check back within a month.
